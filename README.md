# MunderDifflin
SEI Project #1

For this project, I imagined the Dunder Mifflin company from the series decided to expand from B2B to consumers, offering printing services and paper products. As a result, they wanted to update their image to be more modern and customer-friendly.

I used to work in a printing shop and decided to apply some of the nice designs and soft colors I remember from it, while keeping the layout clean and professional. 

Note, since we couldn't use jQuery for this assignment, I "cheated" in the testimonials section and made the images in Photoshop so I could do a simple carousel. In the future, I would use text for the quotes. 

Thanks!
