# MunderDifflin
SEI Project #1

For this project, I imagined the Dunder Mifflin company from the series decided to expand from B2B to consumers, offering printing services and paper products. As a result, they wanted to update their image to be more modern and customer-friendly.

I used to work in a printing shop and decided to apply some of the nice designs and soft colors I remember from it, while keeping the layout clean and professional. I wanted to do more animations, like have a paper airplane move across the screen, but I think this is beyond my current level. :( 

Note, I "cheated" in the testimonials section and made the images in Photoshop so I could do a simple carousel. Ideally, I would use text for the quotes but I couldn't find a way to make this work with regular Javascript. I spent WAY too much time trying to get the navbar to change colors on scroll (seriously took me 6 hours to figure this out) and may have worn out my brain. 

All in all, this was a great learning experience. I started without a wireframe drawn out and added so much code on a whim that could've been simplified and organized better. Some of the new elements I added caused bugs in the previous code I had. In future projects, I will write out my ideas first, do a wireframe and approach the website with better direction on how to implement my ideas.

Thanks!
